# WebSphere Application Server and Openshift

WebSphere Application Server is one of the most widely adopted application servers. Initially created in 1998, its current lineage may be traced back to V5.0, released in 2002. It was a major re-write that enabled it to continue to innovate and remain relevant and popular to its users. Nevertheless, after so many years, as new requirements and new technologies emerged, WebSphere and its users need to once again adjust to the changing landscape. 

In this section we will explain:
- New requirements that are driving changes.
- Why those requirements are best met with cloud based infrastructure.
- How WebSphere itself is changing to work better in a cloud.
- Concepts, processes, and services that may be different to a WebSphere administrator when working in a cloud.
